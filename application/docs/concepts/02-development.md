# Architecture

The backend uses a 3-layer architecture with strict unidirectional dependencies. This keeps the codebase modular, testable, and easy to reason about.

## Layers

| Layer | Responsibility | Can Import | Cannot Import |
|-------|----------------|------------|---------------|
| **API** | Provide the interface for interacting with the zero-shot learning framework | Runtime, Domain | — |
| **Runtime** | Execute zero-shot inference pipelines, manage video streams, broadcast predictions | Domain | API |
| **Domain** | Persist projects, prompts, labels, and model configurations | None | API, Runtime |

> **Rule:** Dependencies flow top-to-bottom only. Never import from a layer above.

## Testing

The layered architecture simplifies testing by providing clear boundaries for mocking.

| Type | Scope | Approach |
|------|-------|----------|
| Unit | Single layer | Mock dependencies from the layer below |
| Integration | Data layer | Test repositories against a real database |
